# ðŸ§  MemoAI â€” AI-Powered Notes in a Single HTML File
MemoAI is a lightweight, offline-first note-taking app built entirely in a single HTML/CSS/JavaScript file.
It combines the power of AI search and summarization with the speed of local full-text search (TBI) â€” all without a backend or cloud sync except for the AI stuff.

âœ… Privacy-first.  
âœ… Runs 100% in your browser (except for AI, but maybe one day that too).  
âœ… Stores notes in IndexedDB.  
âœ… Summarize and search using AI or fallback to offline search with FlexSearch (to be implemented).  
âœ… Markdown-friendly.
